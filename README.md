### Project 1 "Get the Poo"

## Space Invaders style game
Welcome to my Space Invaders styled game, called "_**Get the Poo**_". For our Project 1, I was interested in building a Space Invaders style game to test my HTML, CSS, and JS abilities. Part way through the project I was in the backyard, taking a much needed fresh air break, and I had the distinct pleasure of stepping in some fairly fresh dog poo. I wasn't very excited about getting to thoroughly clean my shoe, but decided instead to try to focus that energy into a theme for my game. 

In "_**Get the Poo**_", as the player is enjoying a sunny afternoon lounging in the grass, they can't help but notice a swarm of smiling dog poos throughout the grass. It's going to be tricky not to get hit by the poo. With the aid of the **"a"** and **"d" keys** on the the keyboard, the player controls a Mickey Mouse styled hand at the bottom of the screen, moving the hand from left to right. With a steady hand and firm grip, the user must deploy poop bags, using the _**space bar**_ at the attacking poos in hopes that thier shoes may live to see another day.
