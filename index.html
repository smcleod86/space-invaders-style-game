            <p>A Space Invaders game brought to you by my misfortune.<br>
            In "Get the Poo", as the player is enjoying a sunny afternoon lounging in the grass, they can't help but notice a swarm of smiling dog poos throughout the yard. Your neighbors would really appreciate it if you picked them up, but it's going to be tricky not to get poo'ed...

            <h3 id="instructions">How to Play</h3>
            <p>With the aid of the "a" and "d" keys on the the keyboard, the player controls a Mickey Mouse styled hand at the bottom of the screen, moving the hand from left to right. With a steady hand and firm grip, the user must deploy poop bags, using the space bar at the attacking poos in hopes that thier shoes may live to see another day. Bag all of the poo before it reaches our hero to achieve ultimate victory!<br />
